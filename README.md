# Hi there 👋
My name is Claire for those of you who don't know me already. I am a Computer Science student, yet to specialize in a field. 
I can identify as a data scientist, as I have done a certificate in data science. I am also a beginner to some of these things, so I would love your input and help in improving my repos.
